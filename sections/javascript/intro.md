# Data structure

The basic idea of a data structure is to store data in a way that meets the needs of your particular application(array, linked list, stack, queue, tree, graph, hash table, etc.).

According to [Wikipedia entry on Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):
>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data.[1][2][3] More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data,[4] i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,[6] while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers

>Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms.
