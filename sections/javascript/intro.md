# Data structure

The basic idea of a data structure is to store data in a way that meets the needs of your particular application(array, linked list, stack, queue, tree, graph, hash table, etc.).

According to [Wikipedia entry on Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):
>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers

>Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms.

# Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task. Every piece of code that is written is an algorithm. The more efficient the algorithm, the faster the program will run.

Why learn algorithms?
- important for all other branches of computer science
- plays a key role in modern technological innovation
- provides novel "lens" on processes outside of computer science and technology:
    - quantum mechanics, economic markets, evolution

>"Perhaps the most important principle for the good algorithm designer is to refuse to be content." -Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms, 1974

You should always ask, CAN WE DO BETTER?
