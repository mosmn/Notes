### Mocking in Testing React Components

Mocking is a technique used in testing to replace certain parts of the system with simulated or controlled objects. In React component testing, mocking can be applied to callback handlers and child components.

#### Testing Callback Handlers

Callback handlers are essential in handling user interactions. To test a component with a callback handler, such as `FavoriteInput`, we can mock and test the `onChange` function.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import FavoriteInput from "./FavoriteInput";

describe("Favorite Input", () => {
  it("calls onChange correct number of times", async () => {
    const onChangeMock = jest.fn();
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    render(<FavoriteInput onChange={onChangeMock} />);
    const input = screen.getByRole("textbox");

    await user.type(input, "Lion");

    expect(onChangeMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(4);
  });

  it("calls onChange with correct argument(s) on each input", async () => {
    const onChangeMock = jest.fn();
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    render(<FavoriteInput onChange={onChangeMock} />);
    const input = screen.getByRole("textbox");

    await user.type(input, "Ox");

    expect(onChangeMock).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(1, "O");
    expect(onChangeMock).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(2, "Ox");
  });

  it("input has correct values", async () => {
    const onChangeMock = jest.fn();
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    render(<FavoriteInput onChange={onChangeMock} />);
    const input = screen.getByRole("textbox");

    await user.type(input, "Whale");

    expect(input).toHaveValue("Whale");
  });
});
```

In these tests, we use `jest.fn()` to mock the `onChange` handler. The first test verifies the correct number of invocations, while the second test checks the correct arguments passed to the handler. The third test ensures that the input element has the correct value.

#### Mocking Child Components

In larger component trees, testing higher-level components can become complex. To simplify the testing process, we can mock child components that are not the primary focus of the test.

```jsx
jest.mock('./child-component', () => {
  return {
    ChildComponent: () => <div>Mocked Child Component</div>,
  };
});
```

In this example, we mock the `ChildComponent` by providing a replacement implementation. This way, when testing the parent component, the child component is replaced with the mocked version, simplifying the test setup and focusing on the behavior of the parent component.

#### Note on Setup and Code Organization

It is recommended to use `userEvent.setup()` before rendering the component and to avoid calling rendering and `userEvent` functions outside of the test itself. If code repetition occurs in multiple tests, it's advised to create a setup function to streamline each test and improve code readability.

Setting up mocks can be done in a `beforeEach` block if desired, but keeping the setup within each test case helps maintain clarity and prevents leakage issues throughout the test suite. If the test file becomes too long, consider using `beforeEach` for setup, but default to setting up in each test case for easier understanding and maintainability.
