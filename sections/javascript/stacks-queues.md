# Stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Common terminology for a stack is

- **Push** - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- **Pop** - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- **Top** - This is the top of the stack.
- **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- **IsEmpty** - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
- **LIFO** - Last In First Out

### Stacks follow these concepts:

- FILO (First In Last Out) : The first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
- LIFO (Last In First Out) : The last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Push O(1)

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an `O(1)` operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top.

### Pop O(1)

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a `pop`, the `top` Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the `top` Node is returned to the user.

Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `pop`. If `isEmpty` returns true, an exception is raised because you are attempting to pop an empty stack.

### Peek O(1)

When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `top` Node of the stack.

Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. If `isEmpty` returns true, an exception is raised because you are attempting to peek an empty stack.

### IsEmpty O(1)

Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty

```js
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

### Stack Implementation

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.top = null;
  }

  push(value) {
    const node = new Node(value);
    node.next = this.top;
    this.top = node;
  }

  pop() {
    if (!this.top) {
      throw new Error('Stack is empty');
    }
    const temp = this.top;
    this.top = this.top.next;
    temp.next = null;
    return temp.value;
  }

  peek() {
    if (!this.top) {
      throw new Error('Stack is empty');
    }
    return this.top.value;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return !this.top;
  }
}
```

## Queue

A queue is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the queue, but does not reference its previous.

### Common terminology for a queue is

- **Enqueue** - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- **Dequeue** - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **Front** - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- **Rear** - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **IsEmpty** - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
- **FIFO** - First In First Out

### Queues follow these concepts:

- FIFO (First In First Out) : The first item added in the queue will be the first item popped out of the queue.
- LILO (Last In Last Out) : The last item added to the queue will be the last item popped out of the queue.

### Enqueue O(1)

When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done by assigning the rear to the new Node and referencing the previous rear to the new rear.

### Dequeue O(1)

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done by re-assigning the front to the next Node in the queue.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. If isEmpty returns true, an exception is raised because you are attempting to dequeue an empty queue.

### Peek O(1)

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. If isEmpty returns true, an exception is raised because you are attempting to peek an empty queue.

### IsEmpty O(1)

Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty

```js
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```

### Queue Implementation

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.front = null;
    this.rear = null;
  }

  enqueue(value) {
    const node = new Node(value);
    if (!this.front) {
      this.front = node;
      this.rear = node;
      return;
    }
    this.rear.next = node;
    this.rear = node;
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (!this.front) {
      throw new Error('Queue is empty');
    }
    const temp = this.front;
    this.front = this.front.next;
    temp.next = null;
    return temp.value;
  }

  peek() {
    if (!this.front) {
      throw new Error('Queue is empty');
    }
    return this.front.value;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return !this.front;
  }
}
```

## Trees

A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship.

### Common Terminology

- **Node** - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
- **Root** - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- **K** - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- **Left** - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- **Right** - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- **Height** - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
- **K-ary Trees** - A k-ary tree is a tree in which each node has up to k children

### Traversals

- **Depth First** - prioritizes going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root.

  - **Pre-order** - root >> left >> right
  - **In-order** - left >> root >> right
  - **Post-order** - left >> right >> root

- **Breadth First** - iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
