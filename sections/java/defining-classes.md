# Programmer-Defined Classes

The following Java code demonstrates the use of programmer-defined classes:

```java
class BicycleRegistration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bicycle bike1, bike2;
        String owner1, owner2;

        bike1 = new Bicycle( ); // Create and assign values to bike1
        bike1.setOwnerName("Adam Smith");

        bike2 = new Bicycle( ); // Create and assign values to bike2
        bike2.setOwnerName("Ben Jones");

        owner1 = bike1.getOwnerName( ); // Output the information
        owner2 = bike2.getOwnerName( );
        
        System.out.println(owner1 + " owns a bicycle.");
        System.out.println(owner2 + " also owns a bicycle.");
    }
}
```

## The Definition of the Bicycle Class

```java
class Bicycle {
    // Data Member
    private String ownerName;
    
    // Constructor: Initializes the data member
    public Bicycle( ) {
        ownerName = "Unknown";
    }
    
    // Returns the name of this bicycle's owner
    public String getOwnerName( ) {
        return ownerName;
    }
    
    // Assigns the name of this bicycle's owner
    public void setOwnerName(String name) {
        ownerName = name;
    }
}
```

## Multiple Instances

Once the Bicycle class is defined, we can create multiple instances:

```java
Bicycle bike1, bike2;

bike1 = new Bicycle( );
bike1.setOwnerName("Adam Smith");
bike2 = new Bicycle( );
bike2.setOwnerName("Ben Jones");
```

This code demonstrates creating instances of the `Bicycle` class, setting owner names, and displaying ownership information.

main class ( ): 
```java
bike1.setOwnerName("Adam Smith");
```
Bicycle class ( ):
```java
public void setOwnerName(String name)
{
 ownerName = name;
}
```

## Data Member Declaration

To declare a data member in Java, you use the following syntax:
```java
<modifiers> <data type> <name>;
```

## Method Declaration

To declare a method in Java, you use the following syntax:
```java
<modifier> <return type> <method name>(<parameters>) {
    <statements>
}
```

- `void`: A method that does not return a value.
- Example:
  ```java
  public void setOwnerName(String name) {
      ownerName = name;
  }

  public String getOwnerName( ) {
      return ownerName;
  }
  ```

- A value-returning method: Returns a value to the caller when called. The return statement should match the declared return type.
- Example:
  ```java
  public String getOwnerName( ) {
      return ownerName;
  }
  ```

- Accessors: Methods that return information about an object. Commonly referred to as "get methods."
- Mutators: Methods that set a property of an object. Commonly referred to as "set methods."

## Constructor

A constructor is a special method executed when a new instance of the class is created. The constructor has the following syntax:
```java
public <class name>(<parameters>) {
    <statements>
}
```

- `<class name>` is the name of the class to which the constructor belongs.
- Constructors are used to initialize data members and perform any other necessary initialization tasks when a new instance is created.

For example, in the context of a `Bicycle` class:
```java
public Bicycle( ) {
    ownerName = "Unknown";
}
```

The `Bicycle` constructor initializes the `ownerName` data member to a default value when a new `Bicycle` instance is created.

## The Program Structure and Source Files

In Java, each class definition is typically stored in a separate source file. For example, if you have two classes, `Bicycle` and `Account`, each class will be defined in its own source file.

## Defining and Using Multiple Classes

In Java, you can define and use multiple classes within a program. Below is an example program that uses both the `Bicycle` and `Account` classes:

```java
class SecondMain {
    // This sample program uses both the Bicycle and Account classes
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bicycle bike;
        Account acct;
        
        String myName = "Jon Java";
        
        bike = new Bicycle( );
        bike.setOwnerName(myName);
        
        acct = new Account( );
        acct.setOwnerName(myName);
        acct.setInitialBalance(250.00);
        
        acct.add(25.00);
        acct.deduct(50);
        
        // Output some information
        System.out.println(bike.getOwnerName() + " owns a bicycle and");
        System.out.println("has $" + acct.getCurrentBalance() + " left in the bank");
    }
}
```

The program defines a `SecondMain` class and uses both the `Bicycle` and `Account` classes to demonstrate their functionality.

## Account Class

```java
class Account {
    private String ownerName;
    private double balance;
    
    public Account( ) {
        ownerName = "Unassigned";
        balance = 0.0;
    }
    
    public void add(double amt) {
        balance = balance + amt;
    }
    
    public void deduct(double amt) {
        balance = balance - amt;
    }
    
    public double getCurrentBalance( ) {
        return balance;
    }
    
    public String getOwnerName( ) {
        return ownerName;
    }
    
    public void setInitialBalance(double bal) {
        balance = bal;
    }
    
    public void setOwnerName(String name) {
        ownerName = name;
    }
}
```

The `Account` class has methods for managing an account's balance, owner's name, and related operations. The example demonstrates creating an `Account` instance and performing various operations on it.

This allows you to see how Java programs can use multiple classes to organize and manage different aspects of your application.
