- Both endl and \n serve the same purpose in C++ – they insert a new line. However, the key difference between them is that endl causes a flushing of the output buffer every time it is called, whereas `\n` does not.   Flushing of buffers is an Operating System task. Each time the buffer is flushed, a request has to be made to the OS and these requests are comparatively expensive. Furthermore, we don’t really need to flush the buffer every time we write something to the stream, since the buffers get flushed automatically when they get full. In the rare cases we do need to perform flushing, we can explicitly specify the operation using either `cout.flush()` or by inserting `std::flush` into the stream.  Writing `\n` characters directly to the stream is more efficient since it doesn’t force a flush like `std::endl`.
