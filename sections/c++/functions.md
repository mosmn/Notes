Protocols are sets of agreed upon rules that have been created by standards organizations.
Models give you a way to visualize the rules and their place in your network.

# The Rules

## Video - Devices in a Bubble

- The only thing a device(pc, phone, etc...) knows is its own addressing information.
- How does a device know its ip and what network it belongs to?
  How does it know if the destination device it nedds to send info to is on the same network or not?
  If the destination device is on a different network, how does it know how to get there?
  How does a source device know if the info sent was received?
  How to know if it needs to resend the info?
    - The answer to all of these questions is Protocols. the rules that govern how devices communicate with each other.
- TCP is the protocol that ensures Reliability.
