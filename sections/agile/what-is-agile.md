# What do you understand about Agile?

Agile software development is a methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid iteration. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban and XP, are used to manage and complete software development projects. Agile methodologies focus on delivering small chunks of working software early and often, and then making adjustments as needed. This allows teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and customer feedback.

Some soft skills that are particularly important in agile software development include:

- Strong collaboration and communication skills, as agile teams rely heavily on frequent and effective communication
- Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, as agile teams are often required to make quick decisions and adapt to changing requirements
- Strong time management and organization skills, as agile teams work in sprints and must deliver working software on a regular basis
- Strong adaptability and flexibility, as agile teams often work in fast-paced and ever-changing environments
- Strong teamwork and leadership skills, as agile teams are cross-functional and rely on all members to contribute to the development proces
