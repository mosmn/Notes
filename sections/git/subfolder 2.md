# Deploying a subfolder to GitHub Pages

Sometimes you want to have a subdirectory on the `master` branch be the root directory of a repository’s `gh-pages` branch. This is useful for things like sites developed with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), or if you have a Jekyll site contained in the `master` branch alongside the rest of your code.

For the sake of this example, let’s pretend the subfolder containing your site is named `dist`.

### Step 1

Remove the `dist` directory from the project’s `.gitignore` file (it’s ignored by default by Yeoman).

### Step 2

Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).

```sh
git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
```

### Step 3

Use subtree push to send it to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

```sh
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```
