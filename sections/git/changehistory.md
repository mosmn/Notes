# Changing history

### Changing The Last Commit

Lets say we run this command:
```shell
git add test3.md && git commit -m 'Create third file and create fourth file'
```
But we forgot to add `test4.md` to the staging area(`git add test4.md`). We can fix this by running:
```shell
git add test4.md
git commit --amend
```
This will open up a text editor where we can change the commit message, Save and close the editor to finish amending the commit.

__only amend commits that have not been pushed anywhere__. The reason for this is that `git commit --amend` does not simply edit the last commit,_it replaces that commit with an entirely new one_. This means that you could potentially destroy a commit other developers are basing their work on.

### Changing Multiple Commits

To modify commits further back in history, we can use the `git rebase` command.

`rebase -i` is a command which allows us to interactively stop after each commit weâ€™re trying to modify, and then make whatever changes we wish.

We do have to tell this command which is the last commit we want to edit. For example, `git rebase -i HEAD~2 `allows us to edit the last two commits.
```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```
- If we wanted to edit one of these commits, we would change the word `pick` to be `edit` for the appropriate commit.
```shell
edit eacf39d Create send file
pick 92ad0af Create third file and create fourth file
```
This would allow us to edit the typo in the Create send file commit to be Create second file.

- If we wanted to remove a commit, we would simply remove it from the list.
- If we wanted to change their order, we would change their position in the list.
