# Parallel Computing Architecture

Flynn's Classical Taxonomy
• There are different ways to classify parallel computers. One of the
more widely used classifications, in use since 1966, is called Flynn's
Taxonomy.
• Flynn's taxonomy distinguishes multi-processor computer
architectures according to how they can be classified along the two
independent dimensions of Instruction and Data. Each of these
dimensions can have only one of two possible states: Single or
Multiple.
