# Part 1: OS definition, objectives and functions

Definition is "What it is", Objectives are "What it aims to do", and Functions are "What it does".

## Definition

- Operating system is a software that controlos the execution of application programs, its an interface between the application and hardware(computer system).
- The applicatin programs do not have direct access to the hardware, they must use the OS to access the hardware.

## Objectives

- Convenience, makes the computer easier to use by acting as an interface between the user and the computer hardware.

Here how a computer is layered:

```mermaid
graph TR;
    A(End User) --> B[Apllication];
    B --> C[Utilities];
    C --> D[Operating System];
    D --> E[Hardware];
```

- Efficiency, uses the computer system resources in an efficient manner. like CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc.


- Ability to Evolve, enables development, testing, and use of new software and hardware without disrupting the system. for example, if you connect a keyboard to the computer, the OS should be able to recognize it and use it.
