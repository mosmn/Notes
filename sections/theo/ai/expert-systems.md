# Organized Outline

## 1. **Introduction**
   - Expert Systems (ES) can perform at a level equivalent to that of a human expert.
   - ES is highly domain-specific, applicable in electronics, law, manufacturing, medicine, and chemistry.
   - Adequate response time, ability to explain reasoning, and handling uncertainties are key features.

## 2. **Definition**
   - ES is a set of computer programs that can advise, consult, diagnose, explain, forecast, interpret, justify, learn, plan, etc.
   - An "expert system" is defined as a computerized clone of a human expert.

## 3. **Expert and ES Shell**
   - **Expert**
     - Possesses considerable knowledge in a specific field.
     - Domain-specific.
   - **ES Shell**
     - A special-purpose tool designed for specific applications.
     - Isolates knowledge bases from the reasoning engine, improving software portability.

## 4. **Shell Concept for Building Expert Systems**
   - Components: KB, Consultation Manager, KB Editors & Debugger, Explanation Program, KBMF Inference Engine Shell.
   - Separation of knowledge base and inference mechanism.

## 5. **Characteristics: Comparison**
   - **Conventional Systems**
     - Information and processing combined.
     - No mistakes, but programmers can make errors.
     - Execution is step-by-step.
   - **Expert Systems**
     - Knowledge base separated from processing.
     - Can operate with incomplete information.
     - Changes in rules are easy to accomplish.

## 6. **Early ES (70s â€“ mid-80s)**
   - **Examples:** MYCIN, DENTRAL, PROSPECTOR, XCON, REVEAL, CENTAUR, HEARSAY I.
   - Characteristics common to early ES.

## 7. **Generic Categories of ES**
   - Interpretation, Prediction, Diagnosis, Design, Planning, Repair, and other categories.

## 8. **Benefits**
   - Expertise in a field made available to more people.
   - Preserves top experts' knowledge.
   - Facts stored systematically.
   - Allows handling more complex problems.

## 9. **Limitations**
   - Systems may be too superficial.
   - Rapid degradation of performance.
   - Crude interfaces.
   - Inability to adapt to multiple types of reasoning.

## 10. **Basic Structure of a Production System**
   - Components: Production Rules, Knowledge Base (KB), Database (DB), User, Inference Engine, Explanation Facility, User Interface.

## 11. **ES Structure**
   - Components: Consultation Environment, Development Environment, User Interface, Inference Engine, Explanation Facility, Working Memory, Facts of the Case, Recommendation.

## 12. **Key Components of ES**
   - Inference Engine, Explanation Module, User Interface, Working Memory, Knowledge Base, Knowledge Acquisition Facility.

## 13. **Explanation Module/Facility/Justifier**
   - Importance of Explanation.
   - Approaches: Canned Text and Paraphrase.
  
## 14. **Inference Engine**
   - Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining.
   - Deduction of conclusions and determination of causes.

## 15. **Summary**
   - Recap of key points.

## 16. **Rule-based Validation**
   - Identifying inconsistencies: Redundant Rules, Conflicting Rules, Subsumed Rules, Unnecessary Premise (IF) Clauses, Circular Rules.
