## Chapter 9: Intelligent Agent

### Introduction to Agents

An agent, as defined in this chapter, refers to anything capable of perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon it through actuators. This chapter explores the concept of agents, their classifications, and specifically delves into intelligent agents.

#### Example of Agents

Agents can range from humans with sensory organs and body parts as actuators to robots equipped with cameras and motors. Even a thermostat, sensing room temperature, can be considered an agent.

#### Sensors and Effect

Agents perceive their environment through sensors, generating a percept sequence. These percepts influence the agent's actions through effectors, creating action sequences.

### Agents Classification

Agents can be classified based on their structure. A simple agent program, or agent function, maps percept sequences to possible actions.

### Intelligent Agents

Intelligent agents exhibit fundamental functionalities such as sensing, understanding, reasoning, and learning. They must be rational, autonomous, and capable of perceiving and acting.

#### Rational Agents

Rational agents aim to maximize their performance measure based on percept sequences, prior knowledge, available actions, and their perceptual history.

### Designing agents

Designing agents involves specifying the task environment (PEAS): Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. Examples of PEAS for various systems, such as an automated taxi driver or medical diagnosis, illustrate this process.

### Classes of Intelligent Agents

Intelligent agents are categorized into five classes based on perceived intelligence and capability:

1. **Simple Reflex Agents:** Decision-making based solely on current percepts.
2. **Model-based Reflex Agents:** Able to work in partially observable environments and track situations.
3. **Goal-based Agents:** Decision-making guided by goals rather than just the current state.
4. **Utility-based Agents:** Introduce utility measurement for a more nuanced measure of success at a given state.
5. **Learning Agents:** Capable of learning from past experiences.

### Applications of Intelligent Agents

Intelligent agents find applications as automated online assistants, offering personalized customer service based on individual needs. Their integration into smartphones is anticipated for future developments.
