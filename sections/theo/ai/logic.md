# Introduction

## Role of Knowledge in Demonstrating Intelligent Behavior

- In demonstrating intelligent behavior, knowledge plays a pivotal role.
- Decision makers rely on knowledge to make informed decisions based on environmental observations.
- Knowledge enables understanding of how to act appropriately in various situations.
- Successful action implies the presence of relevant knowledge.
- The field of AI planning and development seeks to create machines that emulate human behavior, emphasizing the importance of knowledge representation.
- To enable machines to exhibit intelligent behavior, knowledge representation is essential.
- Knowledge representation involves logic as a fundamental technique.
- A knowledge base consists of sentences expressed in a specific knowledge representation language.
- Inference, which entails deriving new sentences from existing ones, is a key aspect of knowledge processing.
- The two primary operations include TELL (adding new sentences) and ASK (querying the knowledge base).

## How to Represent Knowledge in a Machine

1. **Domain**:
   - Focus on a specific domain to represent knowledge.
   - Empower the machine with domain-specific knowledge for intelligent behavior.

2. **Inference Mechanism**:
   - Implement a mechanism to interpret environmental facts using knowledge.
   - This interpretation drives appropriate actions, leading to intelligent behavior.

3. **Syntax and Semantics of a Language**:
   - Define clear syntax (grammar and rules) for the language.
   - Ensure that sentences have meaningful semantics (carry meaning).
   - Clarity in syntax and semantics is vital for effective knowledge representation.

# Logic

- Logic formalizes aspects of language, encompassing syntax, semantics, and deduction.
- It serves as a structured representation of knowledge.
- Logic operates at the symbol level, using symbols such as p, q, and r to represent statements or propositions.
- A statement is a sentence with a truth value, typically denoted as true (T) or false (F).
- Propositional logic deals with statements that can be assigned true or false values.
- Logical operators like AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), IMPLIES (→), and IF AND ONLY IF (↔) are applied to compound propositions.
- Syntax involves propositional symbols, logical operators, and logical constants (TRUE and FALSE).
- Syntax and semantics must be well-defined to create meaningful knowledge representations.
