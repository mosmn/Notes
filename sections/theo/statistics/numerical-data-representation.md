# NUMERICAL DATA REPRESENTATIO

Reporesinting data in terms of numbers.

Graphs / Charts are effective at giving the overall view of a situation
/ a population
✓ HOWEVER
➢ Graphs / Charts cannot give precise information for inferential
purposes (note: infer == to make conclusions)
✓ IN FACT
➢ Graphs / Charts may not be suitable for all cases
➢ e.g : How to describe result of a student for this semester?

Describing Data with Numerical Measures
❑ Numerical measures can be created for both
populations and samples.
✓ A parameter is a numerical descriptive measure
calculated for a population.
✓ A statistic is a numerical descriptive measure
calculated for a sample.
❑ It is best to describe data by using both numerical and
graphical representations whenever possible.

Measures of Center
❖ A measure along the horizontal axis of the data
