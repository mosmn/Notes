# Numerical Data Representation

- Representing data in terms of numbers.
- Graphs/Charts are effective for providing an overall view of a situation or a population.
- However, graphs/charts cannot give precise information for inferential purposes (making conclusions).
- In some cases, graphs/charts may not be suitable. For example, how to describe the results of a student for this semester?

## Describing Data with Numerical Measures

- Numerical measures can be created for both populations and samples.
  - A **parameter** is a numerical descriptive measure calculated for a population.
  - A **statistic** is a numerical descriptive measure calculated for a sample.
- It is best to describe data using both numerical and graphical representations whenever possible.

### Numerical Measures

**Measures of Center**:
- Mean (Average)
- Median
- Mode

**Measures of Variability**:
- Range
- Variance

### Measures of Center

- A measure along the horizontal axis of the data distribution that locates the center of the distribution.

#### Mean

- The mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the total number of measurements (i.e., the average).
- Mean formula:
  - (1/n) ∑xi, where n = the number of measurements, and ∑xi = the sum of all measurements.
- Example: If we have measurements 6, 5, 3, 5, 29, 11, and 56, the mean is calculated as:
  - (6 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 29 + 11 + 56) / 7 = 115 / 7 ≈ 16.43
- In a population, the population mean is represented by the Greek letter "μ" (mu).

#### Median

- The median of a set of measurements is the value that falls in the middle position when the measurements are ordered from smallest to largest.
- The position of the median is 0.5(n + 1) once the measurements have been ordered.
- Example: For a set of measurements 2, 4, 9, 8, 6, 5, 3, when ordered from smallest to largest:
  - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
  - Median position = 0.5(7 + 1) = 4th position
  - Median = 5
- If the number of measurements is even, the median is the average of the two middle values. For example, if there is no 8 in the set:
  - Median position = 0.5(6 + 1) = 3.5th position
  - Median = (5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5 (average of the 3rd and 4th measurements)

#### Mode
❑ The mode is the measurement which occurs most
frequently.
MODULE 2 : NUMERICAL DATA REPRESENTATION
a. The set: 2, 4, 9, 8, 8, 5, 3
The mode is 8, which occurs twice
Example
b. The set: 2, 2, 9, 8, 8, 5, 3
There are two modes which are 8 and 2 (bimodal)
c. The set: 2, 4, 9, 8, 5, 3
There is no mode (each value is unique).
