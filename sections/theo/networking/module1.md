# 1.2 Network components

### Host

All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. some are called end devices, and also clients.

Internet Protocol (IP) address is the number that identifies a host on a network.

- Servers, computers that provide services to end devices e.g. web servers, mail servers, file servers, etc. Each service requires separate server software.
- Clients, computers that use (or send request to the servers) services provided by servers e.g. web browsers, mail clients, etc.

### Peer to peer

Peer to peer (P2P) is when a computer functions as both a client and a server.

Advantages | Disadvantages
--- | ---
Easy to set up | No centralized administration
Less complex | Not as secure
Lower cost | Not scalable
Used for simple tasks: transferring files and sharing printers | Slower performance

### End devices

An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network. each end device on a network has an address that is used to identify it.

### Intermediary Network Devices

Intermediary network devices are used to connect individual end devices to the network. They are also used to connect networks together to form an internetwork.

Their job is to provide connectivity and ensure data flow across the network.

They use the end device destination address in conjunction with info about the network interconnections to determine the path the message should take.

Other roles include:
- Regenerate and retransmit data signals.
- Maintain information about what pathways exist in the network.
- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures.

### Network Media

Network media is the physical medium that carries the data signals from one device to another. e.g copper wire, fiber optic cable, radio waves, etc.

Media Types | Description
--- | ---
Metal wires within cables | Uses electrical impulses
Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) | Uses pulses of light.
Wireless transmission | Uses modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

# 1.3 Network Representations and Topologies

### Network Representation
Network diagrams, often called topology diagrams, use symbols to represent devices within the network.

Specialized terminology used to describe how each of these devices and media connect to each other:
- Network interface card (NIC) - physically connects an end device to the network.
- Physical port - a connector on a network device that connects to a media.
- Interface - specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router are referred to as network interfaces.


### Topology Diagrams

They provide a visual map of how the network is connected. There are two types of topology diagrams: physical and logical.

- Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of devices and media, lets you see the actual location of intermediary devices and cable installations.
- Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network, lets you see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.

# 1.4 Common Types of Networks

### Networks of Many Sizes

Size | Description
--- | ---
Small Home Networks | connect a few computers to each other and the Internet
Small Office/Home Office | enables computer within a home or remote office to connect to a corporate network
Medium to Large Networks | many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected computers
World Wide Networks | connects hundreds of millions of computers worldwide â€“ such as the internet

### LANs and WANs

Network infrastructures vary greatly in
terms of:

- Size of the area covered
- Number of users connected
- Number and types of services available
- Area of responsibility

### The Internet

The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected LANs and WANs (basicly just collection of interconnected networks).
- LANs are connected to each other using WANs.
- WANs may use copper wires, fiber opticcables, and wireless transmissions

Internet is not owned by any single entity. There are organizations that were developed to help maintain the structure and standardization of internet protocols and processes. e.g. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Internet Architecture Board (IAB), etc.

### Intranet and Extranet

Intranet, Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization.

Extranet, Extranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization but is shared with other organizations. so basically it's a private network that is connects more than one organization together.
