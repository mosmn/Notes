# 1.2 Network components

### Host

All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.

Internet Protocol (IP) address is the number that identifies a host on a network.

- Servers, computers that provide services to end devices e.g. web servers, mail servers, file servers, etc. Each service requires separate server software.
- Clients, computers that use (or send request to the servers) services provided by servers e.g. web browsers, mail clients, etc.

### Peer to peer

Peer to peer (P2P) is when a computer functions as both a client and a server.

Advantages | Disadvantages
--- | ---
Easy to set up | No centralized administration
Less complex | Not as secure
Lower cost | Not scalable
Used for simple tasks: transferring files and sharing printers | Slower performance

### End devices

An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network. each end device on a network has an address that is used to identify it.

### Intermediary Network Devices

Intermediary network devices are used to connect individual end devices to the network. They are also used to connect networks together to form an internetwork.

Their job is to provide connectivity and ensure data flow across the network.

They use the end device destination address in conjunction with info about the network interconnections to the path the message should take.

Other roles include:
- Regenerate and retransmit data signals.
- Maintain information about what pathways exist in the network.
- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures.

### Network Media

Network media is the physical medium that carries the data signals from one device to another. e.g copper wire, fiber optic cable, radio waves, etc.

Media Types | Description
Metal wires within cables Uses electrical impulses
Glass or plastic fibers
within cables (fiber-optic
cable)
Uses pulses of light.
Wireless transmission Uses modulation of
specific frequencies of
electromagnetic waves.
