# Binary Number System

### Binary and IPv4 Addresses

- Binary numbering system consists of 1s and 0s, called bits​
- Decimal numbering system consists of digits 0 through 9​
- Hosts, servers, and network equipment using binary addressing to identify each other.​
- Each address is made up of a string of 32 bits, divided into four sections called octets.​
- Each octet contains 8 bits (or 1 byte) separated by a dot.​
- For ease of use by people, this dotted notation is converted to dotted decimal.
