# Purpose of the Physical Layer

### The Physical Connection

A physical connection can be:
- a wired connection using a cable 
- or a wireless connection using radio waves.

The type of physical connection used depends upon the setup of the network.

These are the components of an access point:

1. The wireless antennas (These are embedded inside the router version shown in the figure above.)
2. Several Ethernet switchports
3. An internet port

- Network interface cards (NICs) connect a device to the network.
    - Ethernet NICs are used for a wired connection
    - wireless local area network (WLAN) NICs are used for wireless

Not all physical connections offer the same level of performance.

### The Physical Layer

- The OSI physical layer provides the means to transport the bits that make up a data link layer frame across the network media
- Accepts a complete frame from the Data Link Layer and encodes it as a series of signals that are transmitted to the local media
- This is the last step in the encapsulation process.
- The next device in the path to the destination receives the bits and re-encapsulates the frame, then decides what to do with it.
