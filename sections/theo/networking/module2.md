# Cisco IOS Access

### Operating Systems

- Shell, the user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from computer. These requests can be made either through the CLI or GUI.
- Kernel, communicates between the hardware and software and manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requirements.
- Hardware, the physical components of the computer.

### GUI

- Graphical User Interface allows the user to interact with the system using an environment of graphical icons, menus and windows.
- Most user rely on the GUI to perform tasks on the computer because it requires less knowledge of the underlying command structure that controls the computer.
- However, network devices rely on CLI because GUIs may not always be able to provide all the features that are available in the CLI.
- The CLI is less resource intensive and very stable when compared to a GUI.
- Network operating systems used on may Cisco devices is called Cisco internetwork operating system (IOS). (other OSs include IOS XE, IOS XR, and NX-OS).
