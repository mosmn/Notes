Software testing:
- To show that a program does what it is intended to do
- and to discover program defects before it is put into use.

• Goal :
- Demonstrate to the developer and the
customer that the software meets its
requirements.
- Find inputs or input sequences where the
behavior of the software is incorrect,
undesirable, or does not conform to its
specification.

Can reveal the presence of errors NOT their absence.

Testing is part of a more general verification and
validation process, which also includes static validation
techniques.
- with static we test the software without executing it.
- with dynamic we test the software by executing it.

- Verification: Are we building the product right?
    - The software should conform to its specification.(during specification & design&implementation, its more on preventing errors)
- Validation: Are we building the right product?
    - The software should do what the user really requires.(after we complete the development, its more on finding errors)

Aim and Goal of V&V Process
- Verification to check conformance with the specifications.
- Validation to ensure that the software meets the customer’s expectations.
- Goal of V &V to establish confidence that the software system is “fit for purpose.”

V & V confidence level(this explains why "fit for purpose" is a subjective decision, it dependes on the user)
• Software purpose
• The level of confidence depends on how
critical the software is to an organisation.
• User expectations
• Users may have low expectations of certain
kinds of software.
• Marketing environment
• Getting a product to market early may be
more important than finding defects in the
program.
