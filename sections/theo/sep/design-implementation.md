Design and implementation:
- The stage in the software engineering process at which an executable software system is developed.
- Software design and implementation activities are invariably inter-leaved.
    - Software design is a creative activity in which you identify software components and their relationships, based on a customer’s requirements.
    - Implementation is the process of realizing the design as a program.



# Object oriented design using the UML

An object-oriented design process
- Developing a number of different system models
- For small systems, require a lot of effort and may not be cost-effective
- For large systems, it is an important communication mechanism

Object:
- A real-world element in an object–oriented environment that may have a physical or a conceptual existence.
- An object may have
    - a physical existence, like a customer, a car, etc.
    - an intangible conceptual existence, like a project, a process, etc.

Object Oriented Design:
- object-oriented system : interacting objects that maintain their own local state and provide operations on that state
    - state is private and cannot be accessed directly from outside the object.
- Object-oriented design processes : designing object classes and the relationships between these classes.
    - classes define the objects in the system and their interactions.

Process stages:
1. Define - define the context and modes of use of the system
2. Design - design the system architecture
3. Identify - identify the principal system objects
4. Develop - develop design models
5. Specify - specify object behavior

## System context and interactions

Understanding the relationships between the software that is being designed and its external environment

essential for deciding how to provide the required system functionality and how to structure the system to communicate with its environment. 

The system context establish the boundaries of the system on deciding what features are implemented in the system being designed and what features are in other associated systems.
