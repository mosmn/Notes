# Introduction to RE

As discussed in [chapter 2](/sections/theo/sep/process.md) system requirements are the description of ehat the system should do and the constraints on system operations.

Requirements engineering (RE) -The process sof finding out, analyzing, documenting and schecking these services and constraints.

WHAT IS A REQUIREMENT?
- Definition : a high-level, abstract statement that a system should provide or a constraint on a system.
- Requirements may serve a dual function:
    - May be the basis for a bid for a contract - therefore must be open to interpretation;
    - May be the basis for the contract itself - therefore must be defined in detail;
    - Both these statements may be called requirements.

### TYPES OF REQUIREMENT

1. User requirements: Statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints. Written for customers. High-level abstract requirements
2. System requirements: A structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the systemâ€™s functions, services and operational constraints. Defines what should be implemented. May be part of a contract between client and contractor. Detailed system descriptions

Example:

User requirementss definition
> 1. The Mentcare system shall generate monthly management reports showing the cost of drugs prescribed by each clinic during that month. 

System requirements specification
> 1.1 On the last working day of each month, a summary of the drugs prescribed, their cost and the prescribing clinics shall be generated.
> 1.2 The system shall generate the report for printing after 17.30 on the last working day of the month.
> 1.3 A report shall be created for each clinic and shall list the individual drug names, the total number of prescriptions, the number of doses prescribed and the total cost of the prescribed drugs.
> 1.4 If drugs are available in different dose units (e.g. 10mg, 20mg, etc) separate reports shall be created for each dose unit.
> 1.5 Access to drug cost reports shall be restricted to authorized users as listed on a management access control list.
