Agile software development AKA Rapid software development:

- Rapid development and delivery of software is now often the most important requirement for a software project. because:
    - Businesses operate in a fast-changing environment and is hard to produce a set of stable software requirements.
    - Most of the time requirements are onl clear when the user has gained experience with the software.
    - Software has to evolve quickly to keep up with the changing business environment.
- Plan-driven is essential for some type of systems(critical systems, safety-critical systems, etc.) but doesnt meet these business needs.
- Agile development methods aim is to radically reduce the delivery time of working software systems.

All agile methods have these characteristics in common:
- the processes of specification, design & implementation are interleaved.
- the system is developed in a series od increments.
- Extensive tool support is used to support the development process.

# Agile methods

The dissatisfaction with the overheads involved in software design methods of the 1980s and 1990s led to the creation of agile methods in the late 1990s.
- Allowed developers to focuse on the code rather than the design.
- Are based on an iterative approach to software development.
- Intended to deliver working software as quickly as possible. and evolve the software through the use of feedback from the users.

Aim: to reduce the overheads in the software process (for example, limiting the time spent on documentation) and to be able to respond quickly to changing requirements without excessive rework.

## Agile Manifesto

It values:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

Based on the manifesto, all different agile processes share a common set of principles:

Principle | Description
---|---
Customer involvement | Customers should be closely involved throughout the development process. Their role is provide and prioritize new system requirements and to evaluate the iterations of the system.
Incremental delivery | The software is developed in increments with the customer specifying the requirements to be included in each increment.
People not process | The skills of the development team should be recognized and exploited. Team members should be left to develop their own ways of working without prescriptive processes.
Embrace change | Expect the system requirements to change and so design the system to accommodate these changes.
Maintain simplicity | Focus on simplicity in both the software being developed and in the development process. Wherever possible, actively work to eliminate complexity from the system.

## Applicability

- Product development where a software company is developing a small to medium sized product for sale.
- Custom system development within an organization, where there is a clear commitment from the customer to become involved in the development process and where there are few external rules and regulations that affect the software.​
