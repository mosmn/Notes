# Professional software development

What is meant by software engineering?

Its the discipline that involves in all stages of software production, from the very early stage of software specification to the very late stage of software maintenance when its in use.

- Characteristics of a software system:
    - Abstract, meaning that it is not a physical object.
    - Intangible, meaning that it cannot be touched.
    - not constrained by properties of materials.
    - does not have physical constraints.

- The reasons for software failures:
    - Increase in complexity.
    - Not using Software Engineering methods.

- Types of software products:
    - Generic software products. Stand-alone software products that are marketed to people who want to use them. e.g Microsoft Office.
        - Product Specification: specification are owend by the developer. and any decision for changes to the specification are made by the developer.
    - Custom software products. Software products that are developed for a specific customer. e.g. a software product for a bank.
        - Customer Specification: specification are owend by the customer. and any decision for changes to the specification are made by the customer.

- Attributes of a good software product:
    - Maintainability: Must evolve to meet the changing needs of the customer, specially in a changing business environment.
    - Dependability & security: Must be reliable and secure, not cause any physical or economic damage. and malicious users should not be able to access the system.
    - Efficiency: Must not waste resources, Which includes responsiveness, Utilization of processor and memory
    - Acceptability: Must be acceptable to the customer, which includes usability, learnability, and operability.

- Importance of software engineering:
    - Software is everywhere.
    - Software is expensive.
    - Software is complex.
    - Software is critical.
    - Software is changing.
