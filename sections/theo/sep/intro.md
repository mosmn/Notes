# Professional software development

What is meant by software engineering?

Its the discipline that involves in all stages of software production, from the very early stage of software specification to the very late stage of software maintenance when its in use.

- Characteristics of a software system:
    - Abstract, meaning that it is not a physical object.
    - Intangible, meaning that it cannot be touched.
    - not constrained by properties of materials.
    - does not have physical constraints.

- The reasons for software failures:
    - Increase in complexity.
    - Not using Software Engineering methods.

- Types of software products:
    - Generic software products. Stand-alone software products that are marketed to people who want to use them. e.g Microsoft Office.
        - Product Specification: specification are owend by the developer. and any decision for changes to the specification are made by the developer.
    - Custom software products. Software products that are developed for a specific customer. e.g. a software product for a bank.
        - Customer Specification: specification are owend by the customer. and any decision for changes to the specification are made by the customer.

- Attributes of a good software product:
    - Maintainability: Must evolve to meet the changing needs of the customer, specially in a changing business environment.
    - Dependability & security: Must be reliable and secure, not cause any physical or economic damage. and malicious users should not be able to access the system.
    - Efficiency: Must not waste resources, Which includes responsiveness, Utilization of processor and memory
    - Acceptability: Must be acceptable to the customer, which includes usability, learnability, and operability.

- Importance of software engineering: more and more people rely on advanced software systems to perform their daily tasks. and the software systems are becoming more complex and more critical to the success of the business. therfore, its usually cheaper to develop software systems using software engineering methods than to develop them treating them as a personal one-off project.

- Software process activities:
    1. Software specification, customers and engineers work together to define the requirements of the software system.
    2. Software development, software is built to meet the requirements.
    3. Software validation, software is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements.
    4. Software evolution, software is maintained to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements.

- General issues that affect software:
    - Heterogeneity, operate across a range of different hardware and software platforms.
    - Business and social change, software must be able to adapt to changing business and social needs.
    - Security and trust, software must be secure and trustworthy.
    - Scale, software must be able to operate at a large scale.

# Software engineering ethics

- Issues of personal responsibility:
    - Confidentiality: engineers must not disclose information about the software system to unauthorized people whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place.
    - Competence: engineers must not accept work that they are not competent to do.
    - Intellectual property rights: engineers must acknowledge local laws ruling the ownership of intellectual property. e.g. patents, copyright, and trademarks.
    - Computer misuse: engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse other peopleâ€™s computers.
