Even tho there are many different types of software systems(as introduced in [chap1](/sections/theo/sep/intro.md)), and there is no universal process that can be applied to all of them,
they all must include in some form the four fundamental activities of software engineering: specification, design implementation, validation and evolution.

Its also important to describe what is produced, who is involved and conditions that influence the sequence of activities:

1. Product: outcome of the process activity.
2. Roles: people involved in the process activity.
3. Pre- and post-conditions: conditions that must be satisfied before and after the process activity.
