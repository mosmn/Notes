Even tho there are many different types of software systems(as introduced in [chap1](/sections/theo/sep/intro.md)), and there is no universal process that can be applied to all of them,
they all must include in some form the four fundamental activities of software engineering: specification, design implementation, validation and evolution.

Its also important to describe what is produced, who is involved and conditions that influence the sequence of activities:

1. Product: outcome of the process activity.
2. Roles: people involved in the process activity.
3. Pre- and post-conditions: conditions that must be satisfied before and after the process activity.

Software processes categories:

Plan-driven processes | Agile processes
--- | ---
All of the process activities are planned in advance | Planning is incremental
Progress is measured against the plan | Easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements
Process activities are performed in a fixed sequence | Process activities are performed in a flexible sequence

# Software Process Modules

Its an abstract representation of a process. it presents a descreption of the process from some particular perspective.

## Generic Process Modules

### The waterfall model

Plan-driven model. This approach separates the process into distinct phases, each of which is completed before the next phase begins.

### Incremental development

This approach interleaves the process activities of specification, design, implementation and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions, with each version adding new functionality to the previous version. Could be plan-driven or agile.

### Integration and configuration

This approach relies on the availability of reusable components or systems. The system development focuses on configuring these components for use in the new setting and integrating them into a system. Could be plan-driven or agile.
