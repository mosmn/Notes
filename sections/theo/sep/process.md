Even tho there are many different types of software systems(as introduced in [chap1](/sections/theo/sep/intro.md)), and there is no universal process that can be applied to all of them,
they all must include in some form the four fundamental activities of software engineering: specification, design implementation, validation and evolution.

Its also important to describe what is produced, who is involved and conditions that influence the sequence of activities:

1. Product: outcome of the process activity.
2. Roles: people involved in the process activity.
3. Pre- and post-conditions: conditions that must be satisfied before and after the process activity.

Software processes categories:

Plan-driven processes | Agile processes
--- | ---
All of the process activities are planned in advance | Planning is incremental
Progress is measured against the plan | Easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements
Process activities are performed in a fixed sequence | Process activities are performed in a flexible sequence

# Software Process Modules

Its an abstract representation of a process. it presents a descreption of the process from some particular perspective.

## Generic Process Modules

### The waterfall model

### Incremental development

### Integration and configuration

# Process Activities

# Coping with Change

# Process Improvement
