## Introduction

#### What is Universal Design (UD)?

Universal Design (UD) is the process of designing products so that they can be used by as many people as possible in as many situations as possible. It involves creating products, environments, and systems that are accessible, safe, and convenient for everyone. This philosophy, also known as "Design for All" or "Inclusive Design," responds to the diversity of human populations, their abilities, and their needs.

For example, designing interactive systems that are usable by anyone, with any range of abilities, using any technology platform.

### Definitions

- **The Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access (IDeA Center):** "Universal design makes things more accessible, safer, and convenient for everyone. Also called 'Design for All' or 'Inclusive Design,' it is a philosophy that can be applied to policy, design, and other practices to make products, environments, and systems function better for a wider range of people."

- **The Institute for Human-Centered Design:** "Universal Design is a framework for the design of places, things, information, communication, and policy to be usable by the widest range of people operating in the widest range of situations without special or separate design. Most simply, Universal Design is human-centered design of everything with everyone in mind."

### Universal Design Components

Universal design comprises two major components:

1. Designing products to be flexible enough for direct use.
2. Designing products to be compatible with assistive technologies for those who cannot efficiently access and use the products directly. An example is a plug-and-play device.

### Universal Design Principles

Is it possible to design anything so that anyone can use it? The answer lies in the Seven UD Principles:

1. **Equitable use:** Useful to people with a range of abilities and appealing to all.
2. **Flexibility in use:** Allows for a range of ability and preference through adaptive methods.
3. **Simple and intuitive to use:** Supports user expectations and accommodates different skills.
4. **Perceptible information:** Presents information effectively in different forms/modes.
5. **Tolerance for error:** Minimizes the impact of mistakes or unintended behavior.
6. **Low physical effort:** Comfortable to use, minimizing physical effort and fatigue.
7. **Size and space for approach and use:** Placement should be within reach for users of varying sizes, postures, and mobility.

### Industry on UD

#### Universal Design at Fuji Xerox

Fuji Xerox defines universal design as a design that includes "accessibility," "usability," and "user diversity." This involves making unavailable parts available, making hard-to-use parts easy to use, and expanding the target customer base.

## UD Using Usable Senses

#### Overview
- The five senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell) are fundamental for daily experiences.
- Each sense is crucial on its own, but together, they provide a comprehensive interaction with the natural world.
- Computers typically lack the capability to engage all senses fully.

### Multi-modal vs. Multi-media

- **Multi-modal Systems:**
  - Use more than one sense for interaction.
  - Example: A text processor may employ both visual and aural senses, speaking words while displaying them on the screen.

- **Multi-media Systems:**
  - Use various media to communicate information, often within the visual mode.
  - Example: Computer-based teaching systems may include video, animation, text, still images, and sounds.

### Sound in the Interface

- Sound plays a crucial role in usability.
- Research findings include:
  - Audio confirmation reduces errors.
  - Sound allows users to extract vital information while focusing visually elsewhere.
  - Useful in poorly lit or noisy environments.
  - Can convey transient information without occupying screen space.

#### Speech

- Human beings naturally master speech through listening and mimicking.
- Speech structure in English involves phonemes, allophones, and morphemes.
- People focus on extracting meaning from sentences rather than complex speech structures.

#### Speech Recognition

- **Problems:**
  1. Complexity of language.
  2. Variability in individual speaking styles, including accent, intonation, and pauses.
  3. Background noises can distort input.

- **Benefits:**
  - Offers an additional mode of communication.
  - Useful in situations where hands are occupied.
  - Provides an alternative input for users with visual, physical, or cognitive impairments.

#### Non-Speech Sounds

- Non-speech sounds, such as warnings and alarms, are culture-independent and learned.
- They are useful for providing transitory information, indicating changes, offering status updates, and aiding navigation for visually impaired users.

#### Non-Speech Sound Types

1. **Auditory Icons:**
   - Use natural sounds to represent objects or actions.
   - The challenge is that not all things have associated meanings.

2. **Earcons:**
   - Synthetic sounds representing information through structured combinations of notes.
   - They can be compound or part of a family of sounds, hierarchically structured to represent menus.
        - compound earcons – combine different motives to build up a specific action. E.g., combining the motives for ‘create’ and ‘file’​
        - Family earcons – represent compound earcons of similar types.  E.g., OS errors and syntax errors would be in the ‘error’ family

#### Touch

- Touch is the only sense used for both sending and receiving information.
- Haptic interaction includes
    - cutaneous perception (tactile sensation) and 
    - kinesthetics (movement and position).
- Technologies include electronic braille displays and force feedback devices like the PHANTOM range from SensAble Technologies.

### Handwriting Recognition

- Handwriting is a natural form of communication captured by digitizing tablets.
- Information written onto tablets can be displayed, stored, or redisplayed.
- Problems include variations between handwriting and co-articulation effects.

### Gesture Recognition

- Involves the control of movements by the hand.
- Applications include gestural input and sign language.
- Technologies include computer vision, data gloves, and position sensing devices.
- Benefits include natural interaction and enhanced communication.
- Problems include user dependence and cost considerations.

## Designing for Diversity

#### Introduction
- Human capabilities vary, and users have different needs and limitations.
- Interfaces often target 'average' users, neglecting diversity.
- Universal design is essential, considering factors like disability, age, and culture.

### Users With Disabilities

#### Visual Impairment
- Graphical interfaces (GUI) limit visually impaired users.
- Solutions: screen readers, braille output, sound, tactile interaction.

#### Hearing Impairment
- Less impact on graphical interfaces.
- Solutions: email, instant messaging, gesture recognition, textual captions.

#### Physical Impairment
- Varied control and movement abilities, mouse control issues.
- Solutions: speech input/output, eyegaze systems, predictive systems.

#### Speech Impairment
- Examples: deaf but not mute, dyslexia, autism.
- Solutions: synthetic speech, text-based communication, conferencing systems.

#### Autism
- Impaired social interaction and minimal verbal/non-verbal communication.
- Solutions: computer-mediated communication, virtual environments, graphical information.

#### Dyslexia
- Difficulty reading fluently.
- Solutions: speech input/output, spelling correction, consistent navigation structure.

### Age Groups and Cultural Differences

#### Age Groups
- Older people: disability aids, memory aids, communication tools.
- Children: appropriate input/output devices, involvement in the design process.

#### Cultural Differences
- Influences: nationality, generation, gender, race, sexuality, class, religion, political persuasion.
- Considerations: language translations, layouts, cultural symbols, gestures, use of colors.

#### Cultural Differences – Example
- Example: Mr. Z's advertising project for mineral water (A+) in the Middle East.
- Cultural misinterpretation: Reading direction (left to right) causing a decline in sales.

### Summary

- Universal Design (UD) is a process embedding choices for all users.
- Focus on flexibility, multiple alternatives, and a user-centered approach.
- Recognize diversity in people and things.
- Learning from each other is crucial for designing better things for all.
