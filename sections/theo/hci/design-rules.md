# Design Rules

## Designing for Maximum Usability

- **Goal of Interaction Design:** Focuses on achieving maximum usability.
  
## Principles of Usability

- **General Understanding:** Abstract design rules with low authority and high generality.

## Standards and Guidelines

- **Direction for Design:** Provides guidance for design.
  
## Design Patterns

- **Capture and Reuse Design Knowledge:** Involves documenting and applying reusable design solutions.

## Types of Design Rules

- **Principles:**
  - Abstract design rules with low authority and high generality.
- **Standards:**
  - Specific design rules with high authority but limited application.
- **Guidelines:**
  - Lower authority with more general application.

Increasing Authority

Increasing Generality

## Usability Principles

- **Learnability:** Ease with which new users can begin effective interaction and achieve maximal performance.
- **Flexibility:** Multiplicity of ways the user and system exchange information.
- **Robustness:**
  - Assessing the effect of past actions.
  - Immediate vs. eventual honesty.
- **Synthesizability:**
  - Determining the effect of future actions based on past interaction history.
  - Operation visibility.
- **Predictability:** Assessing the effect of past actions.

## Difference Between Windows 7 and Windows 8

- Comparing the learnability of the two designs.

---

## Learnability

- **Familiarity:**
  - How prior knowledge applies to the new system.
  - Guessability; affordance.
- **Generalizability:**
  - Extending specific interaction knowledge to new situations.
- **Consistency:**
  - Likeness in input/output behavior arising from similar situations or task objectives.

---

## Generalizability Example

- Users are familiar with the toolbar in Microsoft PowerPoint, and the same knowledge applies in Adobe Photoshop toolbar.

---

## Familiarity Example

- A recycle bin is a familiar item in the real world, and the recycle bin icon immediately suggests its function, indicating a collection of items. Similar to a folder for documents.

---

## Consistency Example

- The design of Apple’s products is consistent across devices/platforms, providing the same look and feel for iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or Mac PC.

---

## Dialogue Initiative

- Freedom from system-imposed constraints on input dialogues.
- System vs. user preemptiveness.

## Customizability

- Modifiability of the user interface by the user or system (adaptability or adaptivity).

## Multithreading

- Ability of the system to support user interaction for more than one task at a time.
- Concurrent vs. interleaving; multimodality.

## Substitutivity

- Allowing equivalent values of input and output to be substituted for each other.
- Representation multiplicity; equal opportunity.

## Migratability

- Passing responsibility for task execution between user and system.
- Examples include automated spell checkers, grammar checkers, etc.

**Flexibility**

---

## Dialogue Initiative Example

- Freedom from system-imposed constraints on input dialogues.

## Customizability Example

- Users can choose the appearance of the toolbar according to their preference.

---

## Multithreading Examples

- Multithreading in Mozilla.
- Multithreading in Windows.
- Task migratability in a BMI Calculator.

---

## Robustness

- **Responsiveness:**
  - How the user perceives the rate of communication with the system.
- **Stability:**
  - Task conformance.
  - Degree to which system services support all of the user's tasks.
  - Task completeness; task adequacy.

---

## Using Design Rules

- Design rules suggest how to increase usability.
- They differ in generality and authority.

Increasing Authority

Increasing Generality

---

## Standards

- Set by national or international bodies to ensure compliance by a large community of designers.
- Require sound underlying theory and slowly changing technology.
- Hardware standards are more common than software.
- High authority and low level of detail.
- ISO 9241 defines usability as effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction with which users accomplish tasks.

## Guidelines

### Abstract Guidelines (Principles) Applicable During Early Life Cycle Activities

1. **More Suggestive and General Approach**
   - Design principles that are broad and offer general guidance.

2. **Understanding Justification for Guidelines**
   - Acknowledging the rationale behind guidelines aids in resolving conflicts.

### Detailed Guidelines (Style Guides) Applicable During Later Life Cycle Activities

3. **Golden Rules and Heuristics**
   - "Broad brush" design rules for better design.
   - Useful checklists for good design.
   - Different collections include Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics, Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules, and Norman’s 7 Principles.

#### Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules

4. **Strive for Consistency (Rule 1)**
   - Emphasizes maintaining uniformity in design.

5. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts (Rule 2)**
   - Facilitate efficiency by providing shortcuts for experienced users.

6. **Offer Informative Feedback (Rule 3)**
   - Ensure the system communicates effectively with users.

7. **Dialog Design for Closure (Rule 4)**
   - Design dialogs to give users a sense of completion.

8. **Error Prevention and Handling (Rules 5 and 6)**
   - Provide measures to prevent errors and allow easy reversal of actions.

9. **Support Internal Locus of Control (Rule 7)**
   - Empower users by allowing them to feel in control.

10. **Reduce Short-term Memory Load (Rule 8)**
    - Minimize the cognitive load on users.

#### Norman’s 7 Principles

11. **Use Both Knowledge in the World and Knowledge in the Head (Principle 1)**
    - Leverage external and internal knowledge for design.

12. **Simplify the Structure of Tasks (Principle 2)**
    - Streamline task complexity for user understanding.

13. **Make Things Visible (Principle 3)**
    - Enhance visibility to bridge the gaps of execution and evaluation.

14. **Get the Mappings Right (Principle 4)**
    - Ensure accurate mapping between actions and results.

15. **Exploit the Power of Constraints (Principle 5)**
    - Utilize constraints, both natural and artificial, to guide user interactions.

16. **Design for Error (Principle 6)**
    - Incorporate design elements that minimize errors.

17. **Standardize When All Else Fails (Principle 7)**
    - Standardization as a fallback when other design strategies fail.

### UI Design Patterns

18. **UI Design Patterns Overview**
    - An approach to reusing knowledge about successful design solutions.

19. **Characteristics of Patterns**
    - Capture design practice, not just theory.
    - Represent design knowledge at various levels: social, organizational, conceptual, detailed.
    - Embody values and contribute to humane interface design.

### UI Design Patterns Examples

20. **Examples of UI Design Patterns**
    - Password strength meter.
    - Alternate row colors.
    - Breadcrumb navigation.

### Summary

Principles for usability

- repeatable design for usability relies on maximizing benefit of one
    good design by abstracting out the general properties which can
    direct purposeful design
- The success of designing for usability requires both creative
    insight (new paradigms) and purposeful principled practice
