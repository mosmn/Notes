# Golden Rule of Design

To achieve effective design, it is crucial to follow the golden rule: understand your materials. This involves understanding:

1. **Understand Computers**
   - Recognize the limitations, capacities, tools, and platforms of computers.

2. **Understand People**
   - Consider the psychological and social aspects of human interaction with technology.
   - Take into account the potential for human error and learn how to mitigate it.

3. **Understand how people interact with technology to create a harmonious interface.**

# Design Process

Rosson and Carroll describe the design process as follows:

- Design is a dynamic process, not a static state.
- The design process is nonhierarchical, involving collaboration and multiple phases.
- The process is radically transformational, leading to innovative solutions.
- Design intrinsically involves the discovery of new goals.

## Design Process: Phase 1 - Requirements Analysis

This initial phase involves gathering information regarding system behavior.

## Design Process: Phase 2 – Preliminary and Detailed Design

The design phase consists of two stages:
1. A preliminary stage, where the high-level design or architecture of the interactive system is derived.
2. A detailed stage, where the specifics of each interaction are planned out.

- The preliminary stage is also known as architectural or conceptual design.
- Suitable design methods include sketching, paper mockups, and high-fidelity prototypes.
- These methods can be further clarified using tools, patterns, and best practices.

## Design Process: Phase 3 – Implementation

In this phase, the planning from the previous stages is transformed into actual, running code. The actual software and hardware engineering are executed to achieve this. Consider the following:

- Evaluate tool capabilities, ease of use, ease of learning, cost, and performance.
- Tailor tool choices to match the size and complexity of the project.

## Design Process: Phase 4 – Evaluation

Developers test and validate the system implementation to ensure it aligns with the requirements and design established earlier in the process. This phase is crucial for verifying the success of the design and functionality.

## Design Frameworks

- **User-centered design (UCD)**
  - UCD takes into account the needs, wants, and limitations of the actual end users during each phase of the design process.
  
- **Participatory design (PD)**
  - PD involves the direct involvement of people in the collaborative design of the things and technologies they use.
  
- **Agile Interaction Design**
  - Agile interaction design is about development methods for self-organizing, dynamic teams that facilitate flexible, adaptive, and rapid development, which is robust to changing requirements and needs.

## Design Tools, Practices, and Patterns

- **Design Tools**
  - Dedicated prototyping design tools are specifically designed for creating interface mockups rapidly and effortlessly.

- **Design Guidelines and Standards**
  - Guideline documents are powerful tools for interaction design. They provide standards and best practices for designing interfaces.
  - The "Four E’s" concept includes Education, Enforcement, Exemption, and Enhancement.

- **Interaction Design Patterns**
  - These are best-practice solutions to commonly occurring problems. They are specified in a way that allows them to be reused and applied to slightly different variations of a problem repeatedly.
  - Examples include Model-View-Controller (MVC), document interface, and web app page architecture.

## User Focus

- **Know Your Users**
  - Understand who your users are, and remember that they may not be like you.
  - It's essential to talk to them, watch them, and use your imagination to empathize with their needs.

## User Models

- User modeling and profiling are used to evaluate systems and predict user behaviors.
- Building and modifying a user model is essential for providing a better user experience.
- A user model represents personal data associated with a specific user, used to predict the user's actions and common routines.
- Different types of user models are used based on the application's requirements, and data gathering is crucial in user modeling.

## User Profiling

- User profiling is the process of establishing knowledge about the users.
- Defining user profiles is a key activity in designing interactive systems.
- The "Personas" technique is an excellent way to describe user profiles, including who the users are, their goals in using the product, and the tasks involved.

## Persona

- A persona is a description of an 'example' user, not necessarily a real person.
- Personas are used as surrogate users to understand how they would interact with a product.
- Details matter in creating personas to make them feel 'real' and relatable.

## cultural probes ​

• direct observation ​

– sometimes hard ​

• in the home ​

• psychiatric patients, … ​

Cultural probes are one way to access environments that are difficult to observe directly and also to capture more of this 'felt life'.​

• probe packs ​

– items to prompt responses ​

• e.g. glass to listen at wall, camera, postcard ​

– given to people to open in their own environment they record what is meaningful to them 

## Scenario based design ​

Design based on understanding of users:  what they do, and why ​

User models are used to develop personas ​

Scenarios are narrative explanations of how personas use the product to achieve their goals ​

goal-directed describe the interaction from the user’s viewpoint ​

can be used to define design requirements, design the interaction, and specify interface design elements.

scenarios … ​

• what will users want to do? ​

• step-by-step walkthrough ​

– what can they see (sketches, screen shots) ​

– what do they do (keyboard, mouse etc.) ​

– what are they thinking? ​

• use and reuse throughout design 

### Why use scenarios? ​​

• communicate with others ​

– designers, clients, users ​

• validate other models ​

– ‘play’ it against other models ​

• express dynamics ​

– screenshots – appearance ​

– scenario – behaviour
