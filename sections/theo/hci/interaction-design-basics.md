# Golden Rule of Design

To achieve effective design, it is crucial to follow the golden rule: understand your materials. This involves understanding:

1. **Understand Computers**
   - Recognize the limitations, capacities, tools, and platforms of computers.

2. **Understand People**
   - Consider the psychological and social aspects of human interaction with technology.
   - Take into account the potential for human error and learn how to mitigate it.

3. **Understand how people interact with technology to create a harmonious interface.**

# Design Process

Rosson and Carroll describe the design process as follows:

- Design is a dynamic process, not a static state.
- The design process is nonhierarchical, involving collaboration and multiple phases.
- The process is radically transformational, leading to innovative solutions.
- Design intrinsically involves the discovery of new goals.

## Design Process: Phase 1 - Requirements Analysis

This initial phase involves gathering information regarding system behavior.

## Design Process: Phase 2 – Preliminary and Detailed Design

The design phase consists of two stages:
1. A preliminary stage, where the high-level design or architecture of the interactive system is derived.
2. A detailed stage, where the specifics of each interaction are planned out.

- The preliminary stage is also known as architectural or conceptual design.
- Suitable design methods include sketching, paper mockups, and high-fidelity prototypes.
- These methods can be further clarified using tools, patterns, and best practices.

## Design Process: Phase 3 – Implementation

In this phase, the planning from the previous stages is transformed into actual, running code. The actual software and hardware engineering are executed to achieve this. Consider the following:

- Evaluate tool capabilities, ease of use, ease of learning, cost, and performance.
- Tailor tool choices to match the size and complexity of the project.

## Design Process: Phase 4 – Evaluation

Developers test and validate the system implementation to ensure it aligns with the requirements and design established earlier in the process. This phase is crucial for verifying the success of the design and functionality.

## Design frameworks

User-centered design (UCD)​

Takes the needs, wants, and limitations of the actual end users into account during each phase of the design process​

Participatory design (PD)​

Direct involvement of people in the collaborative design of the things and technologies they use​

Agile interaction design​

Development methods for self-organizing, dynamic teams and that facilitate flexible, adaptive, and rapid development that is robust to changing requirements and needs​

## Design Tools, Practices, and Patterns

Design Tools​

Dedicated prototyping design tools are specifically designed for the purpose of creating interface mockups rapidly and effortlessly​

Design Guidelines and Standards​

Guideline documents are a powerful tool for interaction design​

Four E’s: Education, Enforcement, Exemption, Enhancement​

Interaction Design Patterns​

Best-practice solutions to commonly occurring problems specified in such a way that they can be reused and applied to slightly different variations of a problem over and over again​

Model-View-Controller (MVC), document interface, Web app page architecture ​

# User Focus​
​

Know your users​

• who are they? ​

probably not like you! ​

• talk to them ​

• watch them ​

• use your imagination ​

## User models

User modeling and profiling has been used to evaluate systems and predict user behaviors ​

describes the process of building up and modifying a user model in order to provide for a better user experience​

A user model represents a collection of personal data associated with a specific user, used to predict the users actions and common routines.

There are different types of user models each with their own benefits and determines how data about the user is collected.​

The type of user model used is generally decided based upon the type of application using the user model. ​

The key to user modeling is the data gathering.

## User profiling

The process of establishing knowledge about the users. ​

Defining user profiles is a key activity when designing interactive systems. ​

"Personas" technique is an excellent way for describing these user profiles:​

who the users are​

Children, Elderly, Professional, Scientist, Male, Female, Tech Savvy, IT Illiterate​

what is the goal in using the product ​

Withdraw cash, pay bills, find out movie time, online chat, gaming, research, cook, wash, treatment​

what are the tasks involved? (observe existing work practices)​

E.g. To apply for leave: check schedule, get leave application form from admin, fill in the form, get supervisor to approve, get manager to approve, inform scheduler, inform colleagues, go on leave.

## Persona

description of an ‘example’ user​

not necessarily a real person​

use as surrogate user​

what would Betty think​

details matter​

makes her ‘real’
