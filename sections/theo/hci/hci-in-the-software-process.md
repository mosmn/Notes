## The Design Process

### The Software Life Cycle

- Software engineering is the discipline for understanding the software design process, or life cycle

- Designing for usability occurs at all stages of the life cycle, not as a single isolated activity

### Activities in The Life Cycle

### 1. Requirements Specification

- The designer and customer collaborate to capture the expected system functionality.
- Expressions can range from natural language to more precise languages, such as task analysis.

### 2. Architectural Design

- Provides a high-level description of how the system will offer required services.
- Divides the system into major components and establishes their interrelations.
- Addresses both functional and nonfunctional requirements.

### 3. Detailed Design

- Refinement of architectural components and interrelations.
- Identifies modules to be implemented separately.
- The refinement process adheres to nonfunctional requirements.

### 4. Coding and Unit Testing

- Implementation of the detailed design.
- Unit testing ensures individual components function as intended.

### 5. Integration and Testing

- Combines individual components and tests their interactions.
- Ensures the integrated system functions as a whole.

### 6. Operation and Maintenance

- Ongoing activities to support and enhance the software in its operational environment.

#### The Waterfall Model

The Waterfall Model outlines the sequential phases of the software development life cycle:

1. **Requirements Specification**
2. **Architectural Design**
3. **Detailed Design**
4. **Coding and Unit Testing**
5. **Integration and Testing**
6. **Operation and Maintenance**

### Verification & Validation

- **Verification**: Ensuring the product is designed correctly.
- **Validation**: Ensuring the right product is designed.
- **The Formality Gap**: Validation may rely on subjective means of proof to some extent.
- **Management and Contractual Issues**: Addressing design considerations in commercial and legal contexts.

Real-world Requirements and Constraints:

Understanding the gap between formal requirements and real-world constraints is crucial in software engineering. It involves acknowledging the limitations of formal validation methods.

## Usability

#### Usability : “ the extent to which a product can be used

#### by specified users to achieve specified goals with

#### effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction ina specified

#### context of use.”

## Usability

- Why is usability important?
    - It makes the difference between performing a

#### task accurately and completely or not, and

#### enjoying the process or being frustrated.

- Determine the success or failure of a system
- Poor usability...
- Reduce productivity
- Increase cost time and effort

## Usability

- Usability usually refers to software but is

### relevant to any product. Some ways to

### improve usability include:

- shortening the time to accomplish tasks,
- reducing the number of mistakes made,
- reducing learning time,
- and improving people's satisfaction with a

#### system.

## User Types

- Novice Users:
    - No or limited knowledge of the occupational task to be
       performed, and of computers and interface concepts
- Knowledgeable Intermittent Users:
    - Understanding of the task concepts
    - Broad knowledge of computers and interface
       concepts.
    - Intermittently use the system and may therefore have
       problems with retention
- Expert Frequent (Power) Users:
    - Thoroughly familiar with both task and interface
       concepts. They are likely to use the system often and
       appreciate short cuts to speed their work. 14

## Learning Curves

- Some systems are designed to focus on

### learnability (concern for novice users).

- Others emphasize efficiency for proficient

### users.

- Some support a combination of ease of

### learning and an “expert mode” (for

### example rich menus and dialogues plus a

### command/ scripting language)

## Typical Ways of Measuring Usability

- Learnability

#### How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the

#### first time they encounter the design?

```
Learnability: pick novice users of system, measure time to
perform certain tasks.
```
```
Distinguish between the various timings taken for some general
computer experience.
```

## Typical Ways of Measuring Usability

- Efficiency
- Once users have learned the design, how

### quickly can they perform tasks?

- Efficiency : decide definition of expertise,

### get sample expert users (which tends to be

### difficult), measure time taken to perform

### typical tasks.

## Typical Ways of Measuring Usability

- Memorability
- When users return to the design after a

### period of not using it, how easily can they

### reestablish proficiency?

- Memorability : get sample casual users

### (who are usually away from system for

### certain time/duration) and measure time to

### perform typical tasks.

## Typical Ways of Measuring Usability

- Errors
- How many errors do users make, how

### severe are these errors, and how easily

### can they recover from the errors?

- Errors : count minor and catastrophic

### errors made by users while performing

### some specified task.

## Typical Ways of Measuring Usability

**-** Subjective Satisfaction

```
How pleasant is it to use the design?
```
```
Satisfaction : ask users subjective opinion (questionnaire,
interview), after trying system for real task.
```

## Usability Engineering

- The term usability engineering describes a

#### process of user interface development,

#### sometimes referred to as user centred design.

- It is a lifecycle process that puts an early

#### emphasis on user and task analysis and actual

#### user involvement in the design and testing of a

#### product.

- A product developed with such a user centred

#### process is likely to be a more usable product

#### than one that is developed independent of user

#### considerations and involvement.

#### Detail explanation of Usability Engineering

- Before starting the new design,test the old designto identify the good parts
    that you should keep or emphasize, and the bad parts that give users
    trouble.
- Unless you're working on an intranet,test your competitors' designsto get
    cheap data on a range of alternative interfaces that have similar features to
    your own.
- Conduct afield studyto see how users behave in their natural habitat.
- Make paper prototypesof one or more new design ideas and test them. The
    less time you invest in these design ideas the better, because you'll need to
    change them all based on the test results.
- Refine the design ideas that test best throughmultiple iterations, gradually
    moving from low-fidelity prototyping to high-fidelity representations that run
    on the computer. Test each iteration.
- Inspect the design relative to established usability guidelineswhether from
    your own earlier studies or published research.
- Once you decide on and implement thefinal design, test it again. Subtle
    usability problems always creep in during implementation.

## Usability Engineering Lifecycle

- Identify user requirements and problems
    - Profile Users
    - Task Analysis
- Identify usability goals based on user requirements
- Checkout similar products
- Design and prototype a solution (involve users)
- Evaluate prototype
    - Usability testing (real users and real tasks)
- Reiterate steps 4-5 ...until users are satisfied
- Produce final product

## Usability Engineering Lifecycle – Step 1

## (Users Analysis)

- Identify user requirements and problems:
    - Define your user population.
    - Determine the distribution of skills, knowledge and
       experience within your user population.
    - Assess the user’s skill level with respect to both the
       task and computer domain.

## Example – Step 1

- Identify user requirements and problems:
    - Typical Profile:
       - 40 % Novice Users
       - 57 % Knowledgeable/Intermittent Users
       - 3 % Expert Users
    - Other Important Information:
       - 10 % of user population colour blind
       - 15 % are the elderly

#### Usability Engineering Lifecycle – Step 1 task Analysis

- Identify user requirements and problems:
    - Task analysis allows a designer to identify the goals
       and purposes of the intended user group.
    - This used to involve further analysis of user
       requirements or investigation/observation of
       customers
    - Used to guide user interface design

## Iterative Design and Prototyping

- Iterative design overcomes inherent problems of
    incomplete requirements
- Prototypes
    - simulate or animate some features of intended system
    - different types of prototypes
       - throw-away
       - incremental
       - evolutionary
- Management issues
    - time
    - planning
    - non-functional features
    - contracts


1 - 40
© 2021 Zaihisma Che Cob

## Techniques for Prototyping

- Storyboards
    - need not be computer-based
    - can be animated
- Limited functionality simulations
    - some part of system functionality provided by designers
    - tools like HyperCard are common for these
    - W izard of Oz technique
- Warning about iterative design
    - design inertia – early bad decisions stay bad
    - diagnosing real usability problems in prototypes....
    - .... and not just the symptoms

## Design Thinking

- Design rationale is information that explains why

#### a computer system is the way it is.

- Benefits of design rationale
    - communication throughout life cycle
    - reuse of design knowledge across products
    - enforces design discipline
    - presents arguments for design trade-offs
    - organizes potentially large design space
    - capturing contextual information

## Psychological Design Rationale

- to support task-artefact cycle in which user tasks are
    affected by the systems they use
- aims to make explicit consequences of design for users
- designers identify tasks system will support
- scenarios are suggested to test task
- users are observed on system
- psychological claims of system made explicit
- negative aspects of design can be used to improve next
    iteration of design
