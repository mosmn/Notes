# Responsive Design

## Terminology

- **Responsive Design**: Refers to creating websites that adapt and respond to changes in browser size, making them functional on any device.
- The term can be misleading as it focuses on techniques for implementation rather than the actual aesthetic design of the website.

## What is Responsive Web Design?

- Since the release of the first iPhone in 2007, it has become essential for web projects to work on a wide range of devices, from desktop monitors to small phone screens.
- Responsiveness doesn't happen automatically, especially for complex projects beyond simple text on a page.
- **Responsive Web Design** involves using various techniques to ensure websites function well on any screen size.
- It includes making designs flexible enough to work on most screens and adapting the layout for specific screen sizes.

## Supported Screen Sizes

- Lower End Target: The smallest phones in circulation rarely get smaller than 320px width. Targeting 320px ensures functionality on any small device.
- Upper Limit: Modern ultra-wide monitors can be extremely wide, so it's important to plan for this possibility.
- Accomplishing this is often done by setting a max-width for content and centering it on the page, ensuring it looks fine even on super-wide resolutions.
