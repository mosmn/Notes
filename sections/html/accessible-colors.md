# Accessible Colors

- Using colors on a website can enhance its visual appeal.
- However, improper color combinations or relying solely on color for conveying information can be challenging for some users.
- Careful consideration is necessary when using colors to ensure accessibility.

## Color Contrast

- Contrast ratio measures the difference in brightness between two colors expressed as a ratio.
- Normal text and large text have different contrast ratio requirements:

  - Level AA (minimum) for normal text requires at least 4.5:1 ratio.
  - Level AA (minimum) for large text requires at least 3:1 ratio.
  - Level AAA (enhanced) for normal text requires at least 7:1 ratio.
  - Level AAA (enhanced) for large text requires at least 4.5:1 ratio.

- Exceptions to the contrast ratio rules include:

  - Incidental text within images with significant visual content.
  - Text in inactive or disabled user interface components.
  - Text forming part of a logo or brand name.

- The [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) is a helpful tool for checking contrast ratios using HEX codes.

## Conveying Information

- Relying solely on color to convey information can be problematic for users with color blindness or difficulty distinguishing colors.
- It's essential to avoid using color alone as the only means of conveying information.
- Consider using additional visual cues like text labels or symbols alongside color to ensure information is perceivable and understandable for all users.
