# Web Accessibility

Web accessibility refers to the design and development of websites, tools, and technologies in a way that minimizes barriers for people with disabilities and other circumstantial limitations, allowing them to use these resources effectively.

## Types of Disabilities

- Auditory disabilities: People who have difficulty hearing or are completely deaf.
- Physical/motor disabilities: Individuals with physical impairments that may affect their ability to use traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.
- Cognitive disabilities: Users with cognitive impairments that may affect their ability to understand or navigate websites.
- Visual disabilities: People who are visually impaired or completely blind.
- Disabilities can be permanent or temporary, and users may have multiple disabilities simultaneously.
- Older users with changing abilities may experience similar conditions to those with disabilities.

## Situational Limitations

- Situational limitations are different from disabilities and occur only in specific situations.
- Examples of situational limitations include using a phone in bright sunlight, browsing a site with one hand while multitasking, or dealing with slow internet or expensive bandwidth in a specific location.

## Importance of Web Accessibility

- Web accessibility is crucial to ensure that all users can access and use websites without unnecessary barriers.
- An analogy of a multi-storied building with no elevator is used to illustrate the importance of accessibility. While some users may find it inconvenient, it becomes impossible or significantly more challenging for wheelchair users.
- A website should be developed with various accessibility features and tools to make it usable for people with disabilities, older users, less tech-savvy individuals, and those with situational limitations.
- In some countries, there might be legal requirements to implement web accessibility.

Diverse Abilities and Barriers:
- Understanding the diverse abilities of users with disabilities helps in recognizing the challenges they may face while accessing inaccessible websites.
- To gain a better understanding of the impact of inaccessible sites on users with disabilities, explore the section on ["Diverse Abilities and Barriers."](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/)

Web Accessibility Perspectives:
- The "Web Accessibility Perspectives" videos demonstrate how different users can benefit from accessibility features.
- The videos are short, have audio descriptions and transcripts, providing insights into how accessible websites can enhance user experience.
- Watch the ["Web Accessibility Perspectives"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/) videos to see how various users can benefit from web accessibility features. A compiled version of these videos is available on YouTube.
