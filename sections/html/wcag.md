# Purpose of WCAG

- The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) exist to establish a shared standard for web accessibility.
- They provide guidance on how to make websites more accessible for users with disabilities and other limitations.

# Four Principles of WCAG (POUR)
1. Perceivable: Ensure that information and user interfaces are presented in a way that users can perceive. For example, avoid using light text on a light background that may be difficult for visually impaired users to read.
2. Operable: Ensure that all users can operate user interfaces and navigation. Avoid interactions that can only be performed using a mouse, as this excludes keyboard users.
3. Understandable: Ensure that users can understand the information and user interfaces presented to them. Provide clear and meaningful error messages that users can comprehend and act upon.
4. Robust: Ensure that web content remains accessible as assistive technologies and other user agents advance.

# Conformance Levels

- WCAG has three conformance levels: A, AA, and AAA.
- Level A (essential support) is the minimum conformance level.
- Level AA (ideal support) is the level most organizations strive for, and it includes meeting Level A requirements.
- Level AAA (specialized support) is not recommended for entire sites, as it may be difficult to meet in full. Meeting this level requires meeting both Level A and Level AA.

# Implementing Accessibility

- While this introduces common and simpler concepts, it may not cover every aspect of accessibility.
- No site can be 100% accessible, and certain aspects may not be accessible due to the site's purpose or concept.
- Taking initial steps towards accessibility is essential, and even a minor accessibility feature can make a significant difference to users.
- Don't feel pressured to make everything perfect or implement all accessibility features at once, especially when starting out.

Understanding and adhering to WCAG principles is crucial for creating accessible websites that can be used by all users, including those with disabilities or limitations. While achieving full accessibility may be challenging, taking the first steps and continuously improving accessibility will make a positive impact on user experience and inclusivity.
